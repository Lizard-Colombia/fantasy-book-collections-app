# Fantasy Book Collection
## Purpose
 This is an application designed to help the user keep track of their favorite
 fantasy books such as Harry Potter, Lord of The Rings, Artemis Fowl, etc. It is designed
 to help the the user remember how much they liked a book, where in the series the book
 falls, how many pages it has, and the reading difficulty.
 ## Status
 ### Right now this app has the ability to:
 * List all of the books in Alphabetical Order
 * Edit any single book
 * Add a single book
 * Delete a single book
 ### In the future it would be nice to be able to:
 * Filter the book list
 * Delete multiple books at once
 * Add multiple books at once
 * Edit multiple books at once
 * Create categories and diplay them
